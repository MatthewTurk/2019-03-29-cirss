#### I will be sharing reflections from *my* experiences being a part of the community of open source scholarly/scientific software.

Neither social nor technical changes are distributed evenly over time. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Academic identity is already messed up, and the "marketplace" of projects only worsens it. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Seeking "sustainability" is an inescapably existential problem.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

All is not lost! <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

## Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic.  The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems...

IDL was expensive, and we only had so many licenses. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Also, I felt like I had to prove something. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

(We'll return to this later.) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## The "Perfectly Reasonable Path"

"I remember Python!  It's good for laying out VHS boxes.  I bet it can do this stuff too."

(Unearned confidence will continue to be a theme.) <!--.element: class="fragment" -->

----

## The "Perfectly Reasonable Path"

"Ooh, then I won't have to learn IDL."

```python
import numarray as na
f = open("RedshiftOutput0030.hierarchy")
for line in f.readlines():
    values = line.split("=")
    left = values[0]
    right = values[1]
```

(and so on)

----

## The "Perfectly Reasonable Path"

"Now I just need to figure out how to do unit conversions."

```python

import numarray as na

densityUnits = 1.54e-21

...

```

Still lots of handwritten code.  But guess what that didn't stop me from doing?

That's right, telling other people they should use it!

## The "Perfectly Reasonable Path"

"Wouldn't it be nice if we could see what it did?  Let's try this
locally-developed application, HippoDraw!"

## It worked for me, so...

Maybe other people can do it?

 1. Make this thing
 2. Let other people use it
 3. ???
 4. Profit!

## Growth, but Stable

Our dependency list remained nearly static for a *very* long time:

 * `numpy`
 * `matplotlib`
 * `h5py`

And we went to *great* lengths to keep it that short.

---

## Growth and Scaling!

We aggressively aimed to build a community.

(...let's dissect that "aggression," shall we?) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Assertion 1:

**Neither social nor technical changes are distributed evenly over time.**

<p class="fragment mediumtext">
  The broad landscape didn't change very much for a while.  Within the Python arena, folks mostly used matplotlib, folks mostly used numpy, and folks mostly didn't have a really amazing story for how to install stuff.
</p>
<p class="fragment mediumtext">
  The distinction between people who "made" software in academia and people who "used" software in academia was pretty strong.  Software was just a thing you used, not something you were a part of.
</p>

        OSX was kind of annoying to develop on again, but still pretty usable.

      <p class="fragment">
        Python 3?  Sure, I guess!
      </p>
      <p class="fragment">
        Permissive licenses: the only way to fly.
      </p>
      <p class="fragment">
        "Open Source" was on its way to becoming an assumption in many parts of academia.
      </p>
      <p class="fragment">
        If you weren't using `git`, you were a bit of an outcast.
      </p>
      <p class="fragment">
        "Community" was a buzzword (and a successfully-revived TV show).

    **Personally**

      </p>
      <p class="fragment">

        Turns out, if you're not careful, growth can saturate.

### Assertion 1 (revisited):

**Neither social nor technical changes are distributed evenly over time.**

<p class="fragment mediumtext">
  All of a sudden, practices we thought were innovative -- direct outreach to users to contribute, thinking about capital-C Community, engaging people at many different research backgrounds -- were a bit ... passe.
</p>
<p class="fragment mediumtext">
  Technologies started to shift *rapidly*.  New visualization engines, new parallelism engines and new IO routines became popular and even *prevalent*.
</p>

---

## Inertia

All of a sudden, we had hundreds of users who -- rightly -- were not terribly keen on having everything change underneath them.

And some of us were making the transition to different career paths.

"Look, you have to recognize that this isn't just some thing, it's a Thing, and some of us have built careers around it." --said to me, 2013

## Taking This Seriously

"OK, let's get some funding for it." <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

"Who calls the shots?" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

"Don't pull the rug out!" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Holding Things Back

I held us back in a few critical ways.

## Navigating Disruptive Change

If stability is a key promise, how can we innovate?

If we can't innovate, what can we do?

## Exciting new things!

 * New people!
 * Engage the urge to be A Known Person in *others*.
 * Try some new technologies!
